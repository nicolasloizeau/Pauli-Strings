# Pauli-Strings
Julia module for many-body quantum mechanics with Pauli string represented as binary integers (as in https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.68.042318).

Defines an Operator type and operations on it.

Examples are in `examples.jl`, `lanczos_example.jl` and `time_evolve_example.jl`

## Initializing an operator

Import the library and initialize a operator of 4 qubits
```julia
include("pauli_strings.jl")
import .pauli_strings as ps
H = ps.Operator(4)
```

Add a Pauli strings to the operator
```julia
H += "XYZ1"
H += "1YZY"
```

Add a Pauli string with a coeficient
```julia
H += -1.2,"XXXZ" #coeficient can be complex
```

Add a 2-qubit string coupling qubits i and j with X and Y:
```julia
H += 2, "X", i, "Y", j # with a coeficient=2
H += "X", i, "Y", j # with a coeficient=1
```

Add a 1-qubit string:
```julia
H += 2, "Z", i # with a coeficient=2
H += "Z", i # with a coeficient=1
```

Supported sites operators are `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `Sx`, `Sy`, `Sz`, `S+`, `S-`.

## Basic Algebra
The Operator type supports the +,-,* operators with other Operators and Numbers:
```julia
H3 = H1*H2
H3 = H1+H2
H3 = H1-H2
H3 = H1+2 # adding a scalar is equivalent to adding the unit times the scalar
H = 5*H # multiply operator by a scalar
```
Trace : `ps.trace(H)`

Frobenius norm : `ps.opnorm(H)`

Conjugate transpose : `ps.dagger(H)`

Number of terms: `length(H)`

Commutator: `ps.com(H1, H2)`. This is much faster than `H1*H2-H2*H1`


## Print and export
`print` shows a list of terms with coeficients e.g :
```julia
julia> println(H)
(10.0 - 0.0im) 1ZZ
(5.0 - 0.0im) 1Z1
(15.0 + 0.0im) XYZ
(5.0 + 0.0im) 1YY
```

Export a list of strings with coeficients:
```julia
coefs, strings = ps.op_to_strings(H)
```

## Truncate, Cutoff, Trim, Noise
`ps.truncate(H,M)` removes Pauli strings longer than M (returns a new Operator) 
`ps.cutoff(H,c)` removes Pauli strings with coeficient smaller than c in absolute value (returns a new Operator) 
`ps.trim(H,N)` keeps the first N trings with higest weight (returns a new Operator) 
`ps.prune(H,alpha)` keeps terms with probability 1-exp(-alpha*abs(c)) (returns a new Operator) 

`ps.add_noise(H,g)` adds depolarizing noise that make each strings decay like $e^{gw}$ where $w$ is the lenght of the string. This is usefull when used with `trim` to keep the number of strings manageable during time evolution.


## Time evolution

`ps.rk4(H, O, dt; hbar=1, heisenberg=false)` performs a step of Runge Kutta and returns the new updated O(t+dt)

H can be an Operator, or a function that takes a time and return an Operator. In case H is a function, a time also needs to be passed to `rk4(H, O, dt, t)`. O is an Observable or a density matrix to time evolve. 
If evolving an observable in the heisenberg picture, set `heisenberg=true`.

An example is in `time_evolve_example.jl`.
The following will time evolve O in the Heisenberg picture. At each step, we add depolarizing noise and trim the operator to keep the number of strings manageable 
```julia
function evolve(H, O, M, times, noise)
    dt = times[2]-times[1]
    for t in times
        O = ps.rk4(H, O, dt; heisenberg=true, M=M) #preform one step of rk4, keep only M strings
        O = ps.add_noise(O, noise*dt) #add depolarizingn noise
        O = ps.trim(O, M) # keep the M strings with the largest weight
    end
    return O
end
```

## Lanczos
Compute lanczos coeficients
```julia
bs = ps.lanczos(H, O, steps, nterms)
```
`H` : Hamiltonian

`O` : starting operator

`steps` : number of steps

`nterms` : maximum number of terms in the operator. Used by trim at every step
